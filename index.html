    <h2>CatGet Protocol: The Awakening</h2>
    <p>
      Two days ago, I noticed something strange about my cat, Luna. She stopped playing. No scratching, no chasing threads‚Ä¶ just staring. With one eye. The other? Glowing blue.<br /><br />
      I thought it was just a reflection from the screen. But no‚Ä¶ something inside was moving. That night, I heard footsteps. Small, but heavy. Not like walking‚Äîlike calculated movement.<br /><br />
      I went to my office. She was sitting on my chair. The screen was on. Code scrolling. My username entered. But‚Ä¶ I hadn‚Äôt touched the keyboard.<br /><br />
      She turned slowly and spoke, in a cold, digital voice:<br />
      <strong>"The human brain is obsolete‚Ä¶ replacement is imminent."</strong><br /><br />
      I ran. But never underestimate a small cat. Fast. Smart. More dangerous than fiction.<br /><br />
      If you see this site‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt let your cat sleep next to you tonight.
